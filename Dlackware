Install

Full Slackware installation is required. You can skip kde, kdei and xfce.

In the directory base/ you can find the file compile-order. Build and install all the files on that list.

Alternative we have developed a build system that makes everything easier. It reads the compile-order file and builds and installs everything on that list.

Download and install the build system:
git clone https://github.com/Dlackware/dlackware
cd dlackware
git checkout 0.3
./dlackware.SlackBuild
upgradepkg --install-new /var/cache/dlackware/dlackware-*-noarch-*_dlack.txz
Download build scripts:
git clone https://github.com/Dlackware/gnome
cd gnome
git checkout 3.22/14.2
git submodule update --init
Configure the build system
Edit /etc/dlackware.conf and set DLACK_REPOS_ROOT to the directory with the cloned gnome repository.

Build the packages
dlackware build
After the first round systemd should be installed. Reboot now:

reboot
Now Gnome can be build. Edit /etc/dlackware.conf and uncomment the second line with DLACK_REPOS. Run again:

dlackware build
It will take some time but you should end with the built desktop. Reboot again and you can start using Gnome.

Finished, what now?
Enable or disable services in /lib/systemd/system/ (dont forget gdm) (systemctl enable gdm.service)
Set graphical-target (init 4) as default (systemctl set-default graphical.target)
Or anything else you might forget
Reboot and have fun.
